# Password Cracker
## Background
- Background
A security system is only as strong as the passwords that unlock it.
In this project, you will try to crack the passwords of a simple system that has four- and
six-character passwords. The passwords can contain any ASCII character from 32 (space) to
126 (), but since the passwords are chosen by people, they are not arbitrary strings. You will
use your knowledge of common human frailties to identify the passwords used by a particular user.
This system is particularly insecure because it will accept any of the thirty previous passwords
of the user. Your goal is to write code to guess as many of these as possible.
Submission will be through git, like the first project.
